# Basic Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi) System Using Socket Programming

## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi) system using socket programming in Java. It enables real-time audio transmission from a client to a server within a single access point.

## Key Features

Server-Client Architecture: The system establishes a client-server connection for voice transmission.
Audio Capture and Playback: It captures audio from the client's microphone and plays it back on the server side.
Socket Communication: Data transmission between client and server is managed using basic socket programming.
Concurrent Execution: Threads are employed for concurrent execution of server and client components.
## Learning Outcomes

Socket Programming: Gain practical experience with socket programming concepts in Java.
Audio Streaming: Learn how to capture and transmit audio data in a streaming manner over a network.
Networking Fundamentals: Understand the basics of network communication, including server setup, client connection, and data transmission.
Concurrency: Explore the use of threads for concurrent task execution.
VoWi-Fi Architecture: Gain insights into the architecture of a simple VoWi-Fi system.
## Getting Started

Clone this repository.
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Compile the Java files: javac Server.java Client.java
Run the server: java Server
In a separate terminal, run the client: java Client
## Troubleshooting

Ensure both server and client are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
Check for firewall restrictions that may block communication.
Verify correct port usage in code.
